i ve been struggling with depression for a long time now but i just my first severe instance of depersonalization and it scared me so badly i m not even entirely sure why but something about the fact that i just spent over an hour lying on the floor feeling like my body didn t really belong to me and i might not be real is so extremely unsettling to me i feel more mentally and physically myself now and just trying to process what happened is really difficult if anyone ha any kind of comfort or advice about depersonalization i d appreciate it,1,104

i don t know if this is the right place to talk about this a of lately everything seems so lifeless and empty i feel empty i have family and friend who care for me but still have this void inside i don t know i m just so lost i m not used to posting shit like this i m usually an outgoing guy the type that seems happy and make plan with friend i try acting like i m okay but it s draining talking to people feel draining i know i sound like i m bitching but i m just confused i ve also tried doing a new hobby and working out but it only make me forget about it temporarily,1,124

i started going to therapy cz i suddenly realised that i m not living and that i m just walking through life they told me i have severe depression and anxiety the thing is i feel like i don t know what s wrong with me i don t know why i m feeling that way even though i fully understand all the problem that i have and i know how they re affecting me but i feel like that s not it there must be something else because if i know what s wrong with me it would make sense that i would be able to heal but that s not working even with pill i don t know what to do,1,123

there s this idea that people will say you can always count on me never bottle up your feeling share and you do that and everything will be alright the truth is that people will lose their respect for you they ll think of you a a problem and will just feel obligated of half assing some help not worth it i ll just suffer in silence ok,1,68

i m probably most content when i m by myself don t need anyone to talk to or try to impress but the moment i have to fauxalize fake socialize a i call it and then i get completely irritated and annoyed by any and everyone if they re too happy if they re too talkative if they stand too close etc my irritation level go from 0 to 00 and i just want to completely remove myself from the situation before i blow a fuse,1,86
many time when i want to end the suffering i think of committing suicide or other method to alleviate the pain such a starting to smoke drink drug there are time that i think that one of these method can help me get through the bad moment i am going through but there is always something that in the end prevents me because deep down i know that none of that will help me and that i join it that i can continue fighting a i do and the day will come when i will be free,1,97

you re easily replaceable and trust me they will replace you if you re lucky you ll be born into a loving and sweet family but that s often not the case for most people you re alone and will be alone for most of your time on this earth you ll reach an expiration date for your usefulness and they ll kick you to the curve it doesn t matter if you re really struggling and barely hanging on or if they re aware of what you re going through and they ll give you every excuse in the book but the simple matter of the fact is that they don t care about you anymore what do you have to offer now,1,124

i passed the part where the withdrawal made me feel crap i m slowly becoming the person i wa before med but i really didn t miss it my insecurity is the highest it s ever been in year i ve been ignoring school i ve gained weight there is always this sound in my head saying no one actually want me my usual cheerful self feel forced now it s weird how the feeling i had for year can feel so foreign i don t know a long a my family doesn t know about it it s okay i guess,1,102
the only time i enjoy this life is when i m next to my laptop but i cant stare at it for ever i m always uncomfortable outside my room it s the only safe place i have been told to face reality many time before and when i do i always end up worrying others with my mental state so this time i think i ll face reality head first and i m sure some of them will be sad i know people care for me but i don t care about myself but i care them so by doing this im just helping them long term right im sorry for hurting confusing etc others i never meant to,1,120
i wqs wondering after i remember myself trying lot of med im currently on risperidona 0mg and it working like a charm what dose do you guy use of your med and what type of med for profound psychotic depression,1,40

for long in a while i hit a down again and that come with a lot of thinking like last time when i felt like that i distanced myself from my friend and they didn t even bother to ask me what is wrong with me i m an really introverted person but ask them all the time how they are doing and offer them my support i ask myself when they would if they start to ask themselves where i am if i would just dissappear without saying anything i can t believe i am posting in this sub again but i don t know who to tell stuff like this,1,112
so i came out of clinical depression like month ago i wa never on med i somehow used affirmation and mental exercise however today when i still see people battling mental illness and not address it and be in this successful relationship in front of the world and them coming to me with their relationship issue which point back to their mental health i find this so ironic and make me feel stupid for healing completely cause in this world we live in a healed person is punished with solitude and a person who is goin thru their trauma ha support from someone or something i don t even know what this cycle mean i just wan na know and be for someone out there,1,125
everyone say it get better i have wanted to kill myself since i m now and i wish i had done it then i wish i wa brave back then because thing are only worse now,1,36

it s one thing to feel bad mentally but when i m constantly feeling physically ill a well it make trying to get myself to do positive thing so much harder i can never just feel okay not mentally or physically always in some sort of pain and always feeling like shit then when you ask for help you just get out on a month waiting list,1,67

i want to share something my therapist told me that really resonated and stuck with me she said anxiety is like a smoke detector it go off whenever there smoke to keep you safe but a smoke detector doesn t know the difference between a fire or burnt toast so it s our job to identify what s making the alarm go off and how to manage it most of the time it just burnt toast even if you panic when the alarm first ring you soon realise it burnt toast though difficult anxiety sometimes just need u to take a second to identify the source and put it into perspective is it manageable what s the best way for me to approach it without avoiding it so yeah burnt toast,1,131

it s not easy being useless i am honestly just considering quitting my job and spending these last few day in a hedonistic fashion i hate my family so their feeling don t matter i never understood the logic that i shouldn t kill myself because it would make other people sad it seems like everyone is for doing what s best for you until that thing that s best for you is suicide the rule for suicide are different because when you re suicidal you have to throw what s best for you out the window and do what other people want for you and that s fucking bullshit,1,110
we have absolutely no freedom when it come to our life i personally have a family and i resent them everyday for being the reason i m still a slave to life after a suicidal episode that disease i call hope creep back in and fuel me to slave away for a few month until i burn out again if anyone ha a solution to the family problem let me know ex telling them you re a monk and moving to thailand,1,82

hey i posted a question here a while ago but no one answered i don t know if maybe my question got private it or something i don t think it broke any rule it s just that i m afraid death will leave you conciouss until you decompose or get cremated or that you ll suffocate due to not breathing do we know that being dead mean you re definitely unconscious,1,72
i ve rewritten this time within the past hour it s already am and yet still had the patience for it i want to kill myself and i m stupid if i end up doing it my reasoning it wa for a boy and my effortless attempt at making him happy without me in the picture he ha reddit so i m hoping he doesn t see this due to the fact we follow each other but if he doe thanks for everything thanks for the laugh on the voicecall today and for making me smile everytime i open up the chat i love you and i could only pray that you d love me too,1,116

i used to always think the answer to life wa living i really did but this thing called living is abhorrently cruel all that run through my mind is why would anyone else do it they must know the answer to something i don t they must know that the only thing separating them from everyone else is the collective knowledge possessed to follow through it is such a deep and passionate act that in reality the act itself is the meaning of life the meaning of life is to die,1,91

title more or le i m amab non binary and at the low point of my life so far i need to talk to somebody but i m a bit scared tbh the reason being while i m having more and more s icidal thought and thinking of how pointless life is i know that i m too much of a coward to actually commit to it and i don t want to hog the space for someone who s off worse than me tl dr i don t see much point in living anymore but i just know i most likely won t km is it ok though if i call the hotline,1,114
don t really know why i m posting don t know what to expect i already hate myself more than life itself but it is what it is i caught my wife cheating on valentine s day which wa great we tried to work thing out but apparently she would rather have him a felon drug addict i m not perfect but damn everything s just gone downhill since i don t see a point in life without her but i can t have her so idk i m so lost in every aspect of life i already know how i ll do it but i can t because i can t do that to my granny,1,117
i ve felt this way consistently for probably the last year with only brief deluded relief i hope that it s just eternal oblivion in a sense,1,27
wa looking for this usually i go to bed st but today my wife is sleeping so i will go to km it wa about the time to do it,1,30
i see no future ahead of me and i am very much fucked right now life is going too fast i cant keep up with anything i literally have no friend no one would try to find me if i go missing one day im living in this shit hole away from parent since and they dont even care about me at this point everyone can see that i am going to kill myself but no one even see me at all currently making plan if anyone find my reddit account somehow after i die take this a a sorry i wa a bad kid and became a horrible adult sorry for not doing good thing and making everyone around me sad until i have no one around me left,1,130
i keep thinking that i m only putting all this effort in for someone else because i love her and i don t want to hurt her and i enjoy being with her and how she make me feel but i also want to get better so i can be in a better place to be more supportive for her and my peer i m trying to live for myself and not others but i m not sure where i am with that,1,83
i dont bother doing anything all day and im failing college yet im still tired and im constantly thinking about suicide,1,21
i feel so helpless like i have absolutely no say in my own life and i have no idea what to do anymore all i want to do is to kill myself but the way that i ve decided to do it is going to be painful and right now i ve become so mentally weak that i can t even tolerate or accept pain i wish i could just die in my sleep tonight or get hit by a bus tomorrow because i m not even strong enough to end my life no matter how much i want to,1,100
i ve never been so fucking miserable in my entire life i quit my job last week and i m failing school and want to drop out for the rd time i have no money and i m disgusting and i have no worth in this shitty world i m tired and i can t even get out of bed i don t have any energy to do anything and i want to die fuck everything and goodbye,1,78
i doubt theyd care but at the same time i dont wan na die alone he s the only person i have in my life and our friendship is most likely going to end once he move away but it s going to leave me in shamble i m probably going to attempt soon after he leaf but thats the thing i dont wan na die completely alone yes i still feel a if i have nobody by my side even though we re pretty close but regardless of that i just want to die knowing at least one person will give somewhat of a fuck about me,1,108
i m ready to go it could be day from now week from now or even month from now but this is the only way i see myself going out and i refuse to accept any alternative i ve ghosted numerous people trying to throw their retarded empty platitude my way and a much a some of these mf wan na tell me they ve been there no the fuck they haven t i wish people could just accept the fact that some people weren t meant to live long life,1,91

i just want the pain to end i really want to die my life is not going anywhere i ve got no friend no future etc i m just so completely exhausted and sick of it all i wish i wasn t so sensitive but i just can t take this anymore,1,52
my therapist and psychiatrist say they can t fire me if i follow the protocol and that the program will help me work while doing iop the iop program would only be hour a day on day a week so i could still work part of the time could my job fire me for doing iop worst case scenario i would be able to bounce back but it would be difficult,1,71
i feel so lost and out of control with my emotion i don t know what to do with my free time nothing seems to bring me joy i keep thinking of way to end it all without impacting my family and child but who will find me i don t want to traumatize someone i fight with my wife all the time i don t feel wanted or loved,1,70

feel like there s just too many problem to address at this point everyday i try to hold out in hope of something somehow getting better but it somehow feel like i m never at the bottom of the hill at this point i m only alive so that some people don t feel sad or guilty but honestly i m getting to a point where i don t really give a shit if i m dead i won t have to experience or see the pain that they will ultimately feel from the death so who give a shit,1,100
i don t understand i read it would be lethal to take this much at once but i feel perfectly fine i know i m just going to get a bunch of people telling me to go to a hospital but what s up with this shouldn t i be dead,1,51
my dad killed himself and it left me with a feeling like i want to kill everyone in my family who s moved on since then i m his only child my brother is now a stranger to me my mother is my father s killer i am his only survivor i want to kill myself,1,56
i d love to just to die i dont have friend or family member that care about me haha no one will be sad when im gone which is good honestly but like i mentioned the possibility of religion being real scare me and it the only reason thats stopping me from ending it one day i wont care and i ll do it but it not today sadly,1,69
your life your rule but why can t i finally make myself rest it s selfish but isn t making someone stay just for you to not feel bad also is they ll stop you but will only make you feel alone after a few week or so shouldn t we all ultimately live for ourselves why is suicide such a bad thing is it just because it s deemed morally wrong all of this ha probably been said a couple time i m sorry it s funny how the only thing that keep me going is that one musical group and my other hobby is this really it,1,109

i m done with this world and there s no changing my mind on that but i do know that i don t want my death to mean nothing i m a healthy teenage athlete with a good body so if anyone here know how i could go out but keep my organ preserved for people in need of them i need answer there s people that want to live and me who is done with living so i want to help them live their life if i laid in a tub of ice would it help,1,97
within the last week i ve broken controller one of which i actually stomped on until piece littered the carpet through out my life i ve never broken anything out of anger but now i can t fucking control it i feel le of a man every day when ever i see someone better than me at anything i m constantly angry at work and at home now angry about home stuff when i m at work and angry at work stuff when i m at home i just want to eat a fucking bullet i m a fucking pathetic excuse of a man through and through there s not an ounce of me that is worth anything i am below dirt i should be buried alive i have never had value in any capacity to anyone,1,137
i ve been trying to survive for so many year that i hope the universe will someday grant me the opportunity to finally live my life of all people the broken are the more evolved hence i hope that we the suicidal one will also be given a better shot at life the right opportunity and a kind community because i know in the deepest depth of our heart we really truly want to live although not our current version of life but the better and kinder version of life,1,90
ever since i wa little i wondered what purpose i served in this world i wanted to die because i really did not understand my use today i grew up i thought i had found this answer or that i would find it one day but i do study that don t interest me my family and my friend are far away i just realized that my spouse wa using me from the start and the world is bad i m useless and i don t think i ll ever be used for anything the urge to die is coming to the surface faster than i thought,1,107
everyone ha a particular reason for existence everyone ha a motivation an incentive to move forward in their life life is undoubtedly an amazing gift bestowed by the creator and death is perhaps the biggest nightmare but to some it s the opposite sometimes everything seems meaningless someone like me who is afraid to take even the smallest step that involves pain actually doesn t deserve to live let alone succeed besides what are the odds that i will succeed the feasibility of succeeding seems to be lessening a every single moment is fading away they won t return back i am not writing these word emotionally i am completely within my sense thing lately have been very tough and i know how doe a precarious life can eventually lead to depression and suicidal thought,1,135
i feel like giving up again i thought i had overcome this but i guess not back to square one wanting to die but not wanting to kill myself anyone else feel the same,1,34
i don t feel like myself anymore and i don t think i can be fixed not a day go by where i wish i didn t wake up again i don t know what s wrong and i ve been trying so hard to be better i just can t do it anymore i m so sorry,1,58

i lost everything i have no friend anymore what even is the point anymore there nothing i wan na live for anymore i just wish my life felt worth living my chest hurt so bad i wish i wa enough for myself,1,42
i feel guilty of everything i feel guilty for telling people my problem and burdening them when they re dealing with worse i feel guilty because when people dump their problem on me i can t handle it anymore it s so selfish of me i hate myself for it so much but when people dump their problem on me i just want to kill myself because i m exhausted i m exhausted of helping people i ve been doing it since i wa 0 and i feel so guilty for being exhausted i cut myself over and over for being so selfish,1,103

living is hard every day i try to get up and do better for myself so i can prove to the people that call me an ultimate failure or warn other people that i m no good that i am good and i can be successful but what good is that if in my quiet moment which is a lot my brain eats my heart up sometimes i give into the thought other people have of me what if this what if that what if i wasn t here will this constant pain stop will this ache in my brain and heart disappear or will i be punished by the god i ve prayed to for peace of mind i m sorry for trauma dumping,1,125
i think i have medical problem that will never go away and that if it wasn t for them i could be so much more than i am from personal reflection i m actually really happy with the progress i ve made with myself and in my life since a couple year ago but thing like my anxiety are horrible and if my life will always have it i d rather be dead than continue living not to mention i ve already done most of all my life ha to offer so what s left really amp x 00b i m sorry if this post sound pretentious but i can t find any other post that i can relate to so i ve put it here,1,126

they are not bad people though it my fault they ignore me school drive me crazy and i think ill never be really comfortable with the way life is i dont want to die but i really dont want to live,1,41
my biggest wish is for my family to allow me to end it all i want them to understand the pain and suffering i m going through the constant daily battle that make it so hard to live i want them to be prepared i just want to disappear from life and hurt the least amount of people,1,58
i ve turned this into my blog took it over people depend on me to be alive to function to live yet i hate this planet and pedophile politics religion racism and rapist and they are all allowed to live amongst u why because this god people belive in is cruel in the story book he gave up his son for u yet who ha god to either way i would like to ask him before i go to hell or reborn in this earth to relive this life in a different form my favorite part of the day is when i lay my head down and hope not to wake up the worst part of my day is waking up,1,121
we all know im too much of a pussy to kill myself but fucking hell i want to i want to jump off the bridge near my home being killed by someone would be even better sometimes i imagine myself sending people my goodbye message and killing myself out in the wood there s a tree i stare at every single time i pas it with a perfect horizontal branch this fucking close to buying a noose and just doing it and the worst part is if anyone who knew me irl read this they d think i m joking and that it s stupid but there is nothing i want more than death right now,1,116
i will be 0 then and most probably still lonely af what even is the point i make a shit ton of money at work have hobby but still can t find someone else to share the life with it s pointless what am i even struggling for much better to just fuckin off myself,1,55
i m so tired of existing i have to believe the lie people tell me if i want to be happier in this world that it s not all falling apart that trying hard will get me anything will reward me that people love me it s so much nonsense the only people in my life can t fucking stand me everyone else is at best mildly interested in me from afar and once they get to know me they want nothing more to do with me i m fucking useless and worthless and anyone who s ever told me otherwise want me to suffer what do they see in me i have achieved nothing i am nothing nothing but a corpse too stubborn to start rotting but fully entirely dead,1,131
i have decided to just end my life i ve been dealing with the pain for too long weirdly enough i m not extremely upset but rather calm i m excited that i ll soon be able to die i don t even care about my life anymore and tbh it s great that i feel numb to it all i m not even cry about it i just want the pain to go away and now i ll be able to get rid of the pain i ve just been dealing with anxiety and depression i m ready to go heck it ll be cool to die on my birthday haha,1,112
i just want a hug right now i pissed my gf off and i just want to know that i m forgiven or at least told it s ok,1,29
my plan to have my eternal rest is starting to de rail starting today it frustrating that it is starting to de rail this late in the plan however i guess nothing go according to the plan even my back up plan are starting to de rail too i just want to have my eternal rest but why is the world too unfair that i feel like it keep saying that i should suffer more than what i have experienced,1,80
people in the past day have told me i m not doing enough i m not good enough i m trying my best if my best is causing me so much stress and pain what s the point of living i m nothing after all therapy doesn t help because i m far too socially anxious for it and i can t get medication because i can t go to therapy every reliever or thing that make me happy either doesn t anymore or i don t have time for i can t fucking doing it anymore,1,97
put aside the weightless platitude that everyone say when someone mention suicide i want to know why me considering suicide a a genuine solution is so wrong why wouldn t i want a solution garunteed to work would you rather me live a long miserable life or have me logically decide that i ve had enough and have no more use here help me understand the logic what is so wrong about it this a question that ha continually plagued me so i would appreciate answer,1,86
i ve thought of ending my life so many time but i never end up doing it i just wish there wa a peaceful purposeful way to go out that would be a benefit to others but i suppose life isn t that kind so the next best thing is to donate a body to science right or i hope so ive been thinking that it would benefit my mother with financial trouble she said i m just getting in the way so i think insurance should give her some money i think right now that s my only plausible solution but i just am too chicken,1,107
i ve tried therapy i ve tried medication i know i m trying i quit nicotine i ate better and exercised i don t know what to do it s tiring living like this and having to do it alone i don t drink anymore and still feel the same i m too embarrassed to reach out i wasn t raised in a mental health conscious family i keep flaking on friend but it s because i m so tired man i don t know what to do i don t need anyones help i promise i m not a nice person who deserves it i don t know what to do anymore im just exhausted,1,116

content warning od throwing up hi this is just a vent ig but like last night i really felt like taking an overdose but i decided not to so that i didn t have to throw up cause that happened and i hate it and i don t want to throw up and then die like that would be awful but today i woke up at like three or four am and puked all over the floor and now i m just thinking that me avoiding taking those pill didn t work out like hoped like i still threw up but i m not even dying,1,106
long story short i wa miserable at parent moved out for a year happiest time of my life still sometimes i found myself sad cry and still miserable had to move back in been month hate it here i m starting to think it s just me no matter what i do i still find myself sad amp wondering why i exist usually keep myself extra busy but any downtime i have i ll have these same thought what make you keep going why do you decide to get out of bed every morning what is the literal point of your existence,1,102
i don t see why suicide is selfish in my case if i killed myself to make other people s life better i don t think that should be considered a selfish but im called selfish for wanting to kill myself i don t get it im a fuck up if i m alive and i m a fuck up if i want to kill myself i don t know what to do anymore,1,74

let me explain if you have suicidal thought or behavior technically your not well mentally but if you do drug just time or just for experience it s not a big deal you won t be trapped down watched in a mental hospital taking medication or like abortion it s a woman s body and choice into abort a baby and we should respect their decision but what if a person is cutting or hurting themselves it s a problem even tho it s their decision into doing it but doctor and therapist say it s wrong and something is wrong with them mentally why,1,105
tired of detail just going to get to the point i have attempted before and lately i ve been feeling like attempting again might try to think of a plan or talk myself out of it idk yet we ll see how life treat me the next few day,1,49

sorry about the structure being bad in this i just need to write down my thought i genuinely don t see the point in living anymore i might a well just kill myself now and save myself from the bleak future that is coming with climate change war famine and all this other stuff that is going to happen and show no sign of stopping i might a well just kill myself now before it all go horrible the only thing really keeping me from doing it is the thought of my family and how devastating it would be for them to lose their son i m still young i haven t got a guaranteed future what s the point,1,120
it s almost funny i don t want you to feel like i m giving up i m just worried that you ll start to resent therapy or resent me,1,30
i feel like wanting to die why do i not have friend i feel soo empty lonely i mean i do have a lot of people i talk to on a daily basis but for some reason i feel the need to always have someone almost all the time with me like if i stay alone for hour i feel lonely it is weird i just wish to be happy i don t want to kill myself,1,77
this is it i m sorry but i can t do this anymore i m tired and alone and i used up my resource to help me survive but it s over now i know my ex will be happier without me around and i know he will take care of our cat a i would it s going to suck not being alive anymore but i m done struggling to breathe i m exhausted i m bled dry i hope my friend and family can forgive me,1,88
is it somewhat normal that i want to attempt suicide just to prove to myself that i m actually depressed and suicidal and that i m brave and not a coward sometimes i don t think i m even depressed and that i m just feeling very lonely and numb sometimes i feel like i need to do very dangerous thing so that i don t feel weak and like a failure since people much younger than me commit suicide all the time,1,83
